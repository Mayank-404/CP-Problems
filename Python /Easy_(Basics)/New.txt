You are required to write a function that prints a given number. The function should take a single parameter, which is the number to be printed, and display it on the console.
    def print_number(number):
    print (number)
    

Return the square root of a number.
        def square_root(number):
            return number ** 0.5

Round a number to the nearest whole number.
        # Return Type = float
        # Type of "number" = float
        def round_number(number):
            return round(number)

Given an integer, your goal is to determine if the number is positive, negative, or zero. Return "Positive" if it's greater than 0, return "Negative" if it's less than 0, or return "Zero" if the number is 0.
                string find_sign(int number) {
                    if (number > 0){
                        return "Positive";
                    }
                    else {
                        if (number==0)
                            return "Zero";
                        else
                            return "Negative";
                    }
                }
